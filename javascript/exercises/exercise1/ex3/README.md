### Target: Selecting Elements, Getting Values, and Setting Values
#### _Chapter 3: The Book List_
- Create a webpage with an `h1` of "My Book List".
- Add a script tag to the bottom of the page, where all your JS will go.
- Copy the array of books from the [previous exercise](https://www.teaching-materials.org/javascript/exercises/objects).
- Iterate through the array of books. For each book, create a `p` element with the book title and author and append it to the page.
- Bonus: Use a `ul` and `li` to display the books.
- Bonus: add a property to each book with the URL of the book cover, and add an `img` element for each book on the page.
- Bonus: Change the style of the book depending on whether you have read it or not.
